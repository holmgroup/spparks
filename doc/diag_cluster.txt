diag_style cluster command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style cluster keyword value keyword value ... :pre

cluster = style name of this diagnostic :ulb,l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keyword/value pairs that can be appended to a diagnostic command and which must appear before these keywords :l
keyword = {filename} or {dump} :l
  {filename} value = name
    name = name of file to write clustering results to
  {dump} value = style filename
    style = {standard} or {opendx}
    filename = file to write viz data to :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

diag_style cluster
diag_style cluster stats no delt 1.0 filename cluster3d.a.0.1.dat dump opendx cluster3d.a.0.1.dump :pre

[Description:]

The cluster diagnostic computes a clustering analysis on all lattice
sites in the system, identifying geometric groupings of identical spin
values, e.g. a grain in a grain growth model. The total number of
clusters is printed as stats output via the "stats"_stats.html
command.

Clustering uses a connectivity definition provided by the application
(e.g. sites are adjacent and have same spin value) to identify the set
of connected clusters.

The variants cluster, cluster2d, and cluster3d are used with
applications based on lattice, lattice2d, and lattice3d, respectively.

The {filename} keyword allows an output file to be specified.
Every time the cluster analysis is performed, the key properties
of each cluster are appended to this file. The output format is:

Clustering Analysis for Lattice (diag_style cluster) 
nglobal = {total number of sites}
nprocs = {number of processors} :ul

Time = {time}
ncluster = {total number of cluster}
id ivalue dvalue size
{cluster id} {ivalue} {dvalue} {size} :ul

cluster_id is an arbitrary integer assigned uniquely to each cluster.
It will be different for different numbers of processors.

ivalue is an application-specific integer associated with each cluster. 
For lattice applications, it is the spin value of all sites in the cluster
dvalue is an application-specific double associated with each cluster. 
size is the numbers of sites in the cluster.

The {dump} keyword causes the cluster ID for each site to be printed
out in snapshot format which can be used for visualization purposes.
The cluster IDs are arbitrary integers such that two sites have the
same ID if and only if they belong to the same cluster. The {standard}
setting generates LAMMPS-style. For {cluster2d} and {cluster3d} styles
only two values are printed for each site: site index and cluster
ID. For the {cluster} style, three additional values are printed: the
x, y, and z coordinate of the site (for 2d lattices, z=0).  These
files can be visualized with various tools in the "LAMMPS
package"_lammps and the "Pizza.py package"_pizza.

The {opendx} keyword generates a set of files that can be read by the
OpenDX script called aniso0.net to visualize the clusters in 3D. The
filenames are composed of the input filename, followed by a sequential
number, followed by '.dx'.  Because the OpenDX format assumes a
particular ordering of the sites, the {opendx} style can only be used
with square and simple cubic lattices.

[Restrictions:]

This diagnostic can only be used for on-lattice applications.

Applications need to provide push_connected_neighbors() and
connected_ghosts() functions which are called by this diagnostic.  If
they are not defined, SPPARKS will print an error message.
