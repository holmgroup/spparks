# SPPARKS grain growth simulations
This is a fork of the SPPARKS (11 Nov 2009) software package.
The official SPPARKS repository is located here: [https://github.com/spparks/spparks](https://github.com/spparks/spparks).

This project implements the spparks portion of the *candidate grain* simulations as seen in DeCost & Holm [[1]](#1).





--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Installation 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the preferred method of installation. The image can be built by simply running:
```bash
$ docker build -t spparks-candidate-grains .
```
Many HPC systems use [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html) instead of Docker. The most straightforward way to build the singularity image is to build and export the image from a machine that has Docker, and then use singularity to convert it to the correct format. After building the image with the above command, export the container to a file:
```bash
$ docker save -o spparks-candidate-grains.tar spparks-candidate-grains:latest
```
Next, copy the image to a machine with singularity. The image can be converted to a singularity **.sif** file with the following command:

```bash
$ singularity build spparks-candidate-grains.sif docker-archive:./spparks-candidate-grains.tar
```

# Running a premade input deck.

SPPARKS provides several sample input decks. The simple ising simulation runs instantaneously and can be used to verify the installation.
First, copy the input file to your current directory.
```bash
$ cp spparks/examples/ising/in.ising .
```
## Run with Docker
Next, make a directory to store the outputs of the simulation. Note that it will need to allow the docker container, which may have a different UID than you, to write files. The simplest way to do this is by allowing all permissions.
```bash
$ mkdir results && chmod 777 results
```
Finally, the container can be run to execute the simulation.
```bash
$ docker run --rm \
         -v $(pwd)/in.ising:/home/spparks/in.ising:ro \
         -v $(pwd)/results:/home/spparks/results:rw \
         spparks-candidate-grains \
         bash -c "spparks -in in.ising > results/out.ising"
```
  Summary of `docker run` arguments:
  - `--rm`: removes container after it executes, preventing clutter
  - `-v $(pwd)/in.ising:/home/spparks/in.ising:ro`: mounts the input file `in.ising` into the container as a read-only file.
  - `-v $(pwd)/results:/home/spparks/results:rw`: mounts the output directory `results` to the container so that the output file persists on the host machine after the container exits. Note that this directory on the host machine must allow the container to write files, otherwise it will throw a permission denied error. This is why the folder was created with chmod 777 permissions.
  - `spparks-candidate-grains`: name of the docker image to run.
  - `bash -c "spparks -in in.ising > results/out.ising"`: Run spparks with `in.ising` and save the results to `results/out.ising`.

## Run with Singularity
Running with Singularity is very straightforward:
```bash
$ singularity run spparks-candidate-grains.sif bash -c "spparks -in in.ising > out.ising"
```
Note that Singularity bind mounts `/home/$USER`, `/tmp`, and `$PWD` into the container at runtime, so no explicit mount commands are needed, unlike with Docker. After the container finishes executing, `out.ising` will be in the current directory.

# Building a new input deck
This repository is a fork of the 11 Nov 2009 release of [SPPARKS](https://github.com/spparks/spparks). The SPPARKS documentation covers the majority of the commands. This version provides some additional :

 - `app_style potts/ori`: For running candidate grains simulations with nonuniform boundary mobility from DeCost [[1]](#1).
 - `read_dream3d`: Read in in initial structure generated with [meso](https://github.com/holmgroup/spparks-meso).
 - `stats`: Save grain sizes at desired time interval in h5 file.
 - dream3d format for `dump`: Write results to dream3d file that can be processed with [meso](https://github.com/holmgroup/spparks-meso).

Sample input decks for candidate grains simulations are provided in the meso repository: https://github.com/holmgroup/spparks-meso. The meso repository also provides a command line interface for easily running candidate grains simulations.
